## Ethi:CS -- The Weekly Ethicacy
At the beginning of each session, a designated duo will present on a topic of interest to them (and hopefully all of us!).

### Deliverables:
- PDF in each partner's **ethicacy** folder in your work repo, subject to these guidelines:
  - hyperlink(s) to primary source(s) included
  - summary of issue or newsworthy development
  - single page
  - add to this folder in git repo via pull request
- Other supporting files may be added to ethicacy folder. Each partners' folder must contain all files.

### Presentation
* _GOAL: Each partner takes a side (of an at-least-2-sided issue), and audience gets to hear each argument._
  - ~7-10min
    - (shorter: topic not rich enough)
    - (longer: topic not distilled enough)
  - solicit questions/comments/concerns
* Weekly Ethicacy will take place in two breakout rooms, at the beginning of each week's live session.

### Asynchronous Component
* Within a week of the live session during which a Weekly Ethicacy is delivered, each participant will post to the corresponding thread in the `ethics-async` channel a response:
  - clearly indicating chosen side
  - supporting their choice with supporting documentation, by referencing personal experience, and/or by expanding upon comments from live presentation or preceding channel discussion.

### Presentation Order / Teams
* Duo 1 will present to room 1, Duo 2 will present to room2.
* CSV of randomized pairings: https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/csci77800-fall2022/blob/main/ethicacy_duos.csv
* _Participants are expected to establish communications with their partner as soon as possible, and collaborate to maximize presentation quality._
