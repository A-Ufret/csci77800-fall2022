## Ethi:CS -- The Weekly Ethicacy
At the beginning of each session, a designated duo will present on a topic of interest to them (and hopefully all of us!).

### Deliverables:
- PDF in each partner's **ethicacy** folder in your work repo, subject to these guidelines:
  - hyperlink(s) to primary source(s) included
  - summary of issue or newsworthy development
  - single page
- Other supporting files may be added to ethicacy folder. Each partners' folder must contain all files.

### Presentation
* _GOAL: Each partner takes a side (of an at-least-2-sided issue), and audience gets to hear each argument._
  - ~3-5min per side.
    - (shorter: topic not rich enough)
    - (longer: topic not distilled enough)
  - solicit questions/comments/concerns
* Weekly Ethicacy will take place in two breakout rooms, at the beginning of each week's live session.

### Asynchronous Component
* Within a week of the live session during which a Weekly Ethicacy is delivered, each participant will post to the corresponding thread in the `ethics-we` channel a response:
  - clearly indicating chosen side
  - supporting their choice with supporting documentation, by referencing personal experience, and/or by expanding upon comments from live presentation or preceding channel discussion.

### Presentation Order / Teams
* Duo 1 will present to room 1, Duo 2 will present to room2.
* CSV of randomized pairings: https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/csci77800-fall2022/blob/main/ethicacy_duos.csv
* _Participants are expected to establish communications with their partner as soon as possible, and collaborate to maximize presentation quality._

## Weekly Progression

### Week 1
#### Sync
* What comprises Ethical CS?
* Course overview
  - syllabus
  - grading
  - Github Assignment Repo setup
  - Weekly Ethicacy
  - How async will work (vs assignments and homework)
* **Ground rules for discussions:** _We will grow/learn the most if we..._
  - respect one another's positions.
  - separate person (and their worth) from their opinions/stance.
  - listen for understanding.
  - step into others' shoes.
  - sometimes play "Devil's advocate" to suss out unfamilar/distasteful/problematic positions.

#### Async
* Due 9/14 9:00pm 
* Review pre-reading (ThinkPython Ch.1-4) and additional chapters as necessary, utilize `#python-fu` channel as necessary to discuss.
* Bookmark Ch.9-10 for reference now and later in the term.
* Consult your summer java codebase as necessary, and re-write in python 
  - Game of Nim
  - Game of Life
  - Binary Search : iterative or recursive version
* DELIVERABLE:
```
your-ethics-work-repo/py/nim.py
your-ethics-work-repo/py/gol.py
your-ethics-work-repo/py/binsearch.py
```
  - for each sourcecode file you submit, include a heading comment block in this format:
  ```python
  # FILENAME
  # First Last
  # CSCI 77800 Fall 2022
  # collaborators: 
  # consulted: 
  ```

### Week 2 - 9/8
#### Sync
* No Sync Class
#### Async
- set up work repos
- Python assignment


---

### Week 3 - 9/15
##### Topic: Data Privacy
#### Sync
* Ethicacy
* Breakouts : admin policy / tooling choice
* Breakouts : data privacy


#### Async
* Due 9/21 9:00pm
* First look over the references on this page:
   - https://aboutmyinfo.org/identity/about
* Next, select two services: They could be domain-specific (like an education platform); generic (say, Gmail); or could even be two competitors (like two email providers).
* Read their privacy policies.
* Post the products you are reviewing and comment on one thing for each policy (what it is, why it's good or bad or what raises flags, in your opinion).
* If someone posts re: your chosen product before you do, comment on their thread rather than creating a new one.
* TASK: Write up a short summary comparing and contrasting. Include an overview of what data is collected and maintained and how they may or may not use it.
* If another class member is working on the same two products you can work with them on the writeup. Make sure to include both names and make sure the file is uploaded to both of your repos.
* Save write-up in: `week03/privacy_terms.pdf`
