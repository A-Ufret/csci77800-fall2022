## Course Description

*"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should." - Jurassic Park, Michael Crichton*

Ethical concerns are frequently ignored in technical fields, but as a society we are discovering their immense importance. Algorithms can have unintended affects due to hidden bias, security and privacy can be affected negatively when decisions are made for technical merit or user convenience. Social networks have resulted in issues ranging from fake news to echo chambers and more. In this course we will explore ethical issues in computer science through a combination of programming assignments, case studies and discussions of current events.
